Write Kruskal's Algorithm theory here
1) Sort all the edges in ascending order of their weight. {u, v, wt} => T.C. O(ElogE)
2) Pick the smallest edge. through a loop
3) check if u and v are already joined edges or not, by find (by finding parent of u and v) 
4) If u and v are not joined, then add this edge to the MST via Union of the vertices. 
5) Repeat step 3 and 4 until all the vertices are connected.

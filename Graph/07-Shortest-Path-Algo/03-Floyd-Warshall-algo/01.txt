While Dijksta's algo is used to find the shortest path from a single source to Destination,
Floyd-Warshall algo is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices.

T.C. = O(V^3) where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
S.C. = O(V^2)

Applications:
1. Used in routing algorithms.
2. Used in network routing protocols.
3. Used in finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a directed weighted graph.
4. Used in finding the transitive closure of a graph.
5. Used in detecting negative cycles in a graph.

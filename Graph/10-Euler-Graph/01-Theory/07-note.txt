1) In Eularian Circuit
    -> Start from any node and you will come to an end there itself
    -> All nodes will have even Degree


2) While In Eularian Path
    -> Start and End will not be same node
    -> You cannot start from any node, only from the node which has odd degree will result in Eularian Path
    -> Not all nodes will have even degree, only 2 nodes will have odd degree for it to be Eularian Path aka a Semi Eularian Graph

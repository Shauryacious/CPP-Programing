# Sum of Last k Elements in Arithmetic Series

## Explanation

To compute the sum of the last `k` elements starting from `n`, we can use the concept of an arithmetic series. The series we are interested in is:

\[ \text{sum} = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots + (n-k+1) \]

This series is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a = n - k + 1\) and the last term \(l = n\). The number of terms in this series is \(k\).

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[ \text{sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (2n - k + 1) \]

## C++ Code

Below is the C++ code that incorporates this formula into a `solve` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to compute the sum of the last k elements starting from n
int sumOfLastKElements(int n, int k) {
    return (k * (2 * n - k + 1)) / 2;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example value of n
    int k = 4;  // Example value of k
    int result = sumOfLastKElements(n, k);

    cout << "Sum of last " << k << " elements starting from " << n << " is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

# Understanding the Bitwise NOT Operator (`~`)

The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) is a unary operator that flips the bits of a number. This means that if the ith bit is 0, it will change it to 1 and vice versa.

## Explanation with Example

Let's consider the number 5 as an example.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Binary Representation of 5:**

   - The binary representation of the decimal number 5 is `101`.

2. **Bitwise NOT Operation:**

   - Applying the bitwise NOT operator to 5 flips all the bits:
     ```
     00000000000000000000000000000101 (binary for 5)
     --------------------------------
     11111111111111111111111111111010 (bitwise NOT of 5)
     ```

3. **Sign Bit and Magnitude:**

   - The result after the bitwise NOT operation is `11111111111111111111111111111010`.
   - The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is 1, indicating that the result is a negative number in a 32-bit signed integer representation.

4. **Finding the Magnitude:**
   - To find the magnitude of a negative number represented in two's complement, we use the following two-step process:
     1. **Invert all the bits of the number:**
     ```
     11111111111111111111111111111010 (result from bitwise NOT)
     00000000000000000000000000000101 (inverted bits)
     ```
     2. **Add 1 to the result:**
     ```
       00000000000000000000000000000101 (inverted bits)
     + 00000000000000000000000000000001
       --------------------------------
       00000000000000000000000000000110 (result after adding 1)
     ```
     - The magnitude of the number is `6`.

### Final Result

Thus, the bitwise NOT of 5 in a 32-bit signed integer representation is `-6`.

### Summary

- The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) flips all the bits of a number.
- For a 32-bit signed integer, the result of the bitwise NOT operation on a positive number will be a negative number.
- The magnitude of the negative number can be found by inverting the bits and adding 1 to the result.

In conclusion, applying the bitwise NOT operator to the number 5 results in `-6`.
